#Java Remote Mothod Invocation
##Calculator Example

The Java Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) is a Java API that performs the object-oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls (RPC), with support for direct transfer of serialized Java classes and distributed garbage collection.

Remote Procedure Call: Message passing
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that allows programs to call procedures located on other machines.
RPC uses the client/server model. The requesting program is a client and the service-providing program is the server.
The client stub acts as a proxy for the remote procedure.
The server stub acts as a correspondent to the client stub.
